# G2-my-zPE-mods
My tiny single file Gothic mods that don't deserve their own repository. Written in Daedalus scripting language, runnable with zPE (zParserExtender/Union).

Possible thanks to [Daedalus Injection](https://gothic-modding-community.github.io/gmc/zengin/scripts/extenders/zparserextender/daedalus_injection/).

In order to run, requires [Union](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AkU5qvxIx7zc3kdpGAwlgA-2WiGS7sU5/view). Each mod (each .d file) needs to be placed in game's `/System/Autorun/*` directory, it will be picked up by zParserExtender on game load automatically.
